## What did I Learn?

Building this portfolio was an enriching experience that helped me grow in multiple areas:

1. **Advanced CSS Techniques**: Mastered CSS variables for theme switching, complex animations, and responsive grid layouts
2. **JavaScript Optimization**: Implemented efficient event listeners and intersection observers for performance
3. **Data Science Integration**: Successfully embedded a statistical algorithm (IQR method) into a web interface
4. **UI/UX Principles**: Developed a keen eye for user experience through iterative design improvements
5. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Solved challenges related to consistent rendering across browsers

## What I Enjoyed Most - The Outlier Detection Implementation

The standout feature of this portfolio is the interactive **IQR Outlier Detection** tool. This wasn't just about displaying code, I created a fully functional statistical analyzer that:

- Processes real user input
- Calculates quartiles and interquartile ranges
- Identifies statistical anomalies
- Presents results in an intuitive modal interface

This implementation demonstrates my ability to bridge the gap between complex data science concepts and accessible user interfaces. The algorithm follows rigorous statistical methods while remaining approachable for non-technical users.

**Try it out on my portfolio!** You'll find it in the "Outlier Detection" section where you can test the tool with your own datasets.
